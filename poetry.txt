the box came in the suitcase
held together with belts and tape 

it is smaller than a breadbox
yet holds the past that sustains me 

it is smaller than a shoebox
but i slip on the images inside
and journey 1000s of miles
and scores of years

it is the story of a changing America
the story of multiracial love
the story of the accepting family and friends

it belies the prenatal stress of my mother
not telling her family
leaving me at the hospital once i was born

it was the three of us 
in constant motion
criss-crossing the States 
itinerant works for the military industrial complex

moving every two months on average
for the first seven years of my life

the box is the journal of those travels
the rest of the stuff left by the wayside
we travelled light like the stuff of legends

pictures of cars we don't remember owning
pictures of places we might have lived
pictures of people i've never known
pictures of things i guess we did

at 18 i had agency over my own journeys
i traversed the States for school
for work
for pleasure

i once attempted to go on permanent vacation
wanting to escape the past
and any possible futures
