the box comes in the suitcase
held together with belts and tape 

it is smaller than a breadbox
yet holds the past that sustains me 

it is smaller than a shoebox
but i slip on the images inside
and journey 1000s of miles
and scores of years

it is the story of a changing America
the story of multiracial love
the story of the accepting family and friends

it belies the prenatal stress of my mother
not telling her family
leaving me at the hospital once i was born
