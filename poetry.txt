the box was stashed in a suitcase
held together with belts and tape 

it is smaller than a breadbox
yet holds the past that sustains me 

it is smaller than a shoebox
but i slip on the images inside
and journey thousands of miles
and scores of years

it is the story of a changing America
the story of multiracial love

it is the story of an accepting America
the story of supportive family and friends

smiling faces present at places
belying the prenatal stress of my mother
who did not tell her family
she left me at the hospital once i was born

i was early by two months
and she went back to her small life

in less than two months
she met a man she married in two weeks

the improbable love
between two people from two different worlds
who just knew they would be together
forever and ever

they went back to the orphanage
and adopted me back into my family

our lives changed in an instant
a connection forged in a whirlwind of love

it was the three of us 
in constant motion
criss-crossing the States 
dad chasing money for contract work

moving every two months on average
for the first seven years of my life

the box is the journal of those travels
the rest of the stuff left by the wayside

pictures of cars we don't remember owning
pictures of places we might have lived
pictures of people i've never known
pictures of things i guess we did

after four different kindergartens
and six different first grades

they realized the flaws of being
itinerant workers for the military industrial complex

we settled in the heartland
amidst the wheat fields and runways
life was as simple
as the people were hateful 

we kept to ourselves
we honored our accomplishments

instead of vacations we travelled to
the family who smiled and welcomed us home

the road was a part of us
we could drive forever
speeding through snow and rain
in our big American cars 

at 18 i gained agency over my own journeys
i travelled these States for school work and pleasure

the motion from childhood 
made leaving a security blanket

i once attempted to go on permanent vacation
wanting to escape the past
and any possible futures
yet ended up in Portland and called it my home
